</p>

As clearly observed, there is a linear upward trend in the total amount of revenue received (and an implied number of entrants) in the APRA AMCOS Vanda and Young Songwriting Competition between the period of 2009-2021. From this observation, a continued trend in upward revenue and entrants may continue to be expected in competition years to come. 

## Considerations

1. There is a statistical anomaly in the 2011 total revenue calculation. This may be a data error, as there are no indicatinos of significant events or restrictions which may have resulted in such a significant drop in total amounts/submissions received in 2011.
